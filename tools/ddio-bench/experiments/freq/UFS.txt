Uncore Frequency Scaling:

Read page 290 of Energy-Efficient Servers book [3] for more information. 

* Check the current frequency: 

sudo rdmsr 0x621

The value is hexadecimal. After converting it to decimal, you should multiply it by 100 MHz.

see page 220 of [3]


* Change the frequency:

sudo wrmsr 0x620 0x1818

The frequency conversion is similar to the checking part. The value is a 16-bit hexadecimal number. Bit 15-8 shows the minimum frequency while bit 7-0 shows the maximum frequency. 

** Remember the default value before changing it. Otherwise, you have to reset the system. 

* Note that the default value of MSR 0x620 shows the range. On skylake machines, the default value is 0xc18, i.e., the minimum frequency is (0xc=12 * 100 MHz = 1.2 GHz) and the maximum frequency is (0x18=24 x 100 MHz = 2.4 GHz). This is similar to the values reported in [1].

* We can set the change the frequency by setting both min/max to the same value and read the 0x621 register. According to [3], setting the value to 0x3f3f will maximize the uncore frequency scaling.
